# M1OEP-Multiple-Classes-asmith16
This is Drew Smiths Multiple Classes Project for CS120

## Why did i choose these classes
The classes were chosen because and Employee and a company are two things that go together and seemed interesting to program
These classes and structs work together to allow a company to have a list of applicants along with a list of employee's


## Operator choices
The operators I chose to overload were the comparasin operators
specifically the ==, <=, >= I did these for both classes
Employee's are compared on what level of employee they are which is determined using my enumerated type
Companies are compared with the number of employees they have

## Enum choice
I chose to use an enum to save the position of an employee becuase it makes comparing emplyee's based on their position much easier
This usage makes sense for my class because a company will want to be able to group or compare employees easily


## Struct choice
I chose to use a struct for an applicant because a company will want to use less resources for a person until they have determined they are going to be hired
This allows for much easier adjustments and usage of the aplicants overall

## My main program
Main starts by creating a company object
Following this it will create a hand full of employees and a few applicants and add them to the vectors in the company
After creating employees and applicants I will show the functionality of my overloaded operators
Main will also compare two company objects aswell.
